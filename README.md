# The Blue Snail Challenge

A safe, absurd, satirical web game parodying rage-inducing challenges and terrible UX. 50 levels of harmless nonsense. Snails approve.

## Notes

- This is satire. No harm, no data is sent anywhere. Webcam/mic prompts are faked.
- Everything runs locally, no servers, no tracking, no storage.
